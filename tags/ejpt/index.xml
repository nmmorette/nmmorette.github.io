      <description>Introduction This is my review of the eJPTv2 certification offered by INE. Initially, I purchased the voucher for the exam, version V1, without including the training. Later, I was able to exchange it for the V2 version with INE, a process that went smoothly and without complications or costs.
I decided not to participate in the training offered by INE, a choice based on my pre-existing experience in the field. This experience led me to believe that I already had the necessary knowledge to take the eJPT exam without the need for additional preparation.</description>
